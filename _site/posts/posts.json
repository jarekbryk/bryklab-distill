    "contents": "\nThis paper was a long time coming and I am very glad it is finally, officially out (although the resources it describes have been stealthily popular for some time already). The original idea is what brought me to the National Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading back in 2012, where, along with Dean Madden and John Schollar, we came up with the idea of using some synthetic biology approaches to develop a simple and extensible system of parts and plasmids to enable assembly and characterisation of them in undergaduate settings (check out our poster from SB6 in London). (Later we developed it further, to make it work in secondary schools and six forms, the primary market for NCBE.) We quickly made some progress (see the bacterial transformation kit availabe in NCBE since 2014) and put the protocols for the manipulation of the parts online (the website is no longer available).\nThen I started my independent position at Huddersfield and soon afterwards Dean suddenly died; John retired shortly after than and by the time I got around to finishing these resources, it was 2017. It was thanks to two of my project and placement students at Huddersfield, Abbie Williams and Alex Siddall, who took the project up and developed the plasmids and parts to the point where they could be deposited in Addgene for all to use.\nJason Sanders, another student at Huddersfield, also prepared the graphical materials - plasmid maps - which we hope will be useful for educators to prepare their own assembly diagrams. They are excellent, if I say so myself ;-).\nCheck them all out and enjoy: Unigems: plasmids and parts to facilitate teaching on assembly, gene expression control and logic in E. coli.\n\n\n\n",

We knew we would be able to do this once\nMarisa switched to the four-adapter protocol by Franchini et al., and\nshe and a fellow PhD student at Huddersfield, Bernardo, went away with\nthe analysis. Rohan‚Äôs project delivered another few hundreds of samples\ngenotyped with the same adapters and protocol, and in two different PCR\nsetups. We had all the pieces for a really high-powered study. So, what\ndid we find?\nThe bad news is that chimeras are there and most of the protocols do\nnot allow for their identification at all, particularly if you\nput several multiplexed groups of samples on a single lane (as you most\nlikely do). The good news is that if you maintain good quality standards\nin your wet-lab and computational pipeline (high molecular weight DNA,\nhigh coverage filters etc.), impact of the chimeras is minimal. We also\nhave found that you should probably not attempt barcode rescue beyond 2\nmismatches, as above that level you may be mainly creating chimeric\nrather than recovering actual reads.\nEnjoy the paper and congratulations to all involved!\nIdentification\nand quantification of chimeric sequencing reads in a highly multiplexed\nRAD-seq protocol\n\n\n\n",

The position is officially adverstised on findaphd.com and the deadline in on March 26th (!).\n(*The university announced 15 projects in total but only 8 studentships, and only projects that will attract the best candidates overall will be awarded the positions.)\nBelow is a slightly modified text of the announcement that will go live any day now on evoldir.\nRodents from the genus Apodemus are the most common mammals in the Palearctic and an attractive subject for evolutionary and molecular studies: they are likely to be under multitude of selective pressures in different habitats, they contribute to the spread of Lyme disease and tick‚Äìborne encephalitis and harbour extra (‚ÄúB‚Äù) chromosomes. However, the genomic and genetic resources for their studies remain very limited.\nWe are a young and small research group that has recently embarked on establishing phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships between Apodemus populations in Europe based on whole-genome genotypes. Thanks to collaboration with researchers in Poland, Germany and Belgium we are presently acquiring and analysing whole-genome high-density genotyping data (ddRAD-seq) from hundreds of individuals across Europe. Analysis of this data will inform future directions of our studies: phylogeography of sylvaticus and flavicolis, diversity and divergence of their populations, SNP-based genetic maps and whole-genome scans for signatures of positive selection.\nWe are looking for an independent candidate with keen interest in evolution and computational approaches to study genetic variation on a population scale. Familiarity with UNIX/Linux, command line or R is a plus, as is research experience, preferably on a master‚Äôs level, but strong B.Sc. graduates are also encouraged to apply. Majority of the project involves computational analyses of large datasets, but it has a small wet-lab component, such as preparation of DNA and/or RNA sequencing libraries.\nThe PhD student will be associated with the Evolutionary and Environmental Genomics Group at the Department of Biological Sciences and embedded with PhD students in the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Centre who work on human and cattle phylogeography, archaeoentomology, yeast transposable elements and evolution of choanoflagellates using genomic approaches. The studentship requires candidates to undertake small teaching duties during the PhD. For more information about us and our work, please go to bryklab.net/research/ and Jarek Bryk‚Äôs staff profile. Candidates are encouraged to contact the project‚Äôs supervisor, Dr Jarek Bryk, directly with informal questions and requests.\nTo apply, send an email outlining your motivation and experience to j.bryk@hud.ac.uk (CC‚Äôd to f.cross@hud.ac.uk), including a CV and the names of two referees. You also need to complete an on-line application. For more details about the application process please go to the official announcement on findaphd.com.\n\n\n\n",

It‚Äôs called Stirley Community Farm and it includes a community centre, where they recently launched ‚ÄúCake and Nature‚Äù series of talks‚Äîhence my visit.\nThe talk will take place on 16th February at 7pm (map) and I will be talking on how we use DNA to study evolution. The full abstract of my talk is below:\nIn the last decade, biological sciences have undergone a revolution: due to breakthrough developments in sequencing technologies‚Äîthe capability to read DNA‚Äîit is now possible to obtain complete genetic information on a population scale. Apart from more mainstream application of these advances, such as genealogy or identification of disease‚Äìcausing mutations, one of the most exciting is our ability to study patterns of genetic variation in wild populations of almost any species. This ability, coupled with studies of the genetics material of long‚Äìextinct organisms, allows unprecedented insight into the evolutionary history of many species.\nI will provide an overview of how we study molecular basis of evolutionary change by looking at DNA of modern and extinct species through several examples, from metabolism of bacteria and wings of peppered moths through the beaks of Darwin‚Äôs finches to the fur of beach mice and others, including the most self-obsessed of the apes, humans.\nThese advances are being developed on the background of our ability to also synthesize DNA of a desired sequence and modify DNA in situ to an extraordinary degree. Overall, they have turned biology into a sophisticated, statistics‚Äìbased and data‚Äìdriven discipline not unlike high-energy physics, justifying the expectations that the XXI century will be the age of biology.\nSee you there!\n\n\n\n",
