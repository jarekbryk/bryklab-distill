      "contents": "\n\nI studied biology and obtained MSc in molecular biology from the University of Warsaw, Poland.\nFollowing my interest in science education and communication, after the\nuniversity I co–founded and directed Science Festival School at\nthe International Institute for\nMolecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw. It was one of the first\nfull–time bioscience popularisation organisations in Poland and it is\nstill active today as the Centre\nfor Innovative Bioscience Education.\nHaving decided to learn more and do research in evolutionary\ngenetics, I started my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for\nEvolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where I worked on\nmetabolic and behavioural consequences of expression of putatively\nadaptive human genes in transgenic mice. I generated mice transgenic for\ngenes thought to be important in human evolution, like GLUD2, a\nhominoid-specific gene encoding neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme\nglutamate dehydrogenase or a group of genes including ASPM and CENPJ\nthat play a role in brain development and whose mutations cause\nmicrocephaly in humans. During my PhD I become more interested in\nfunctional and mechanistic basis of adaptive change, and followed this\ndirection during a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for\nEvolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany, where I worked on\nidentification of putatively adaptive genes in wild, non-model organism\nusing whole–genome approaches. I studied copy-number variants in natural\npopulations of Mus musculus domestics using custom made\nmicroarrays and microsatellite scans to identify CNVs under putative\nselective sweeps.\nI then switched my focus back to teaching and became involved in\nsecondary and undergraduate education in the National Centre for Biotechnology\nEducation at the University of\nReading, UK, where I undertook a EU–funded project to develop\npractical teaching resources in synthetic biology for undergraduates. I\nworked on development of DNA parts,\nplasmids and protocols to manipulate them, as well as organised\nworkshops for undergraduates and A-level students in synthetic biology.\nI helped establish and mentored the first Reading team for the International Genetically Engineered\nMachines competition, where the student–driven project—construction and\ncharacterisation of solar–powered, cyanobacteria-based fuel cell was\nawarded a bronze medal. During a subsequent Wellcome Trust’s Society\nAward to NCBE, I initiated development of similar experimental synthetic\nbiology resources for A–level students before joining University of\nHuddersfield.\n\n\n\n",

They\noccupy environments as different as Spain and Siberia, contribute to\nspread of human diseases like Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne\nencephalitis and are a rich target for evolutionary studies. However,\nthey are very underdeveloped in terms of their genomic and genetic\nresources. Our long-term goal is to help establish Apodemus as\na full–blown model organism and utilise its generalist ecology for\nstudies of evolution in the wild.\n\nPhylogeography of\nApodemus mice\nThe major project we are currently undertaking is on improving the\nEuropean phylogeography of the two species, Apodemus flavicolis\n(yellow-necked mouse, also confusingly called wood mouse in Polish) and\nApodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse). The goal is to collect and\ndescribe large(ish)-scale (n > 350 samples) data on genetic diversity\nand connectivity of the species and help answer some of the mysteries of\nrecolonisation of Europe by small mammals following the last glaciation.\nThe project is helmed by Maria Luisa Martin Cerezo and utilises\nrestriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to obtain\nwhole-genome, high-density genotypes even without a reference genome. It\nhas been possible thanks to a number of colleagues across Europe, from\nScotland and Portugal through Serbia to Lithuania, who provided samples\nfrom across the range of both species.\nThe first publication from this project, a small-scale\nphylogeographic analysis of Polish populations of Apodemus, has\nbeen published in 2020: Population\nstructure of Apodemus flavicollis and comparison to Apodemus sylvaticus\nin northern Poland based on RAD-seq\nGenetics and\nenergetics in Apodemus mice\nThe second project, run by Rohan Raval in collaboration with Drs\nKarol Zub and Jan Boratyński at the Mammal Research Institute\nof the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland, will\ncharacterise the patterns of metabolic rates in a single population of\nA flavicolis continually sampled for multiple seasons. The\nproject involves genotyping and pedigree analysis of a large, wild\npopulation of mice and lab-based measures of basal metabolic rates (BMR)\nand torpor. Our goal is to measure heritability of BMR in the wild\nthroughout multiple seasons as well as in-depth characterisation of\npopulation structure and dynamics.\nSeventy\nyears of genetic variation in a population of Apodemus flavicolis\nin Białowieża forest\nDue its wide range and large population size, Apodemus has\nbeen a popular ecological model organism since a long time before the\nadvent of modern sequencing methods. Many museums and field stations\nhave amassed collections of Apodemus samples, which are a large\nand largely untapped resource of genetic history of these species. The\nchallenge in accessing this information is degradation of DNA, making it\ndifficult to obtain a set of orthologous loci from multiple individuals.\nWe have recently been funded by NERC\nNBAF to develop and/or modify existing DNA pull-down methods to\nextract orthologous loci from even highly degraded DNA and use it in\nRAD-seq genotyping. On this project, we are collaborating with MRI PAS,\nthanks to whom we have access to an extensive collection of\nApodemus samples dating back to the second World War and with\nprof. Nadir Alvarez\nfrom the Natural\nHistory Museum of Geneva in Switzerland, who previously developed\nRAD-seq pull-down techniques to be used in insects and plants. We hope\nthat these methods will enable spatial and temporal comparisons of\ngenetic diversity in Apodemus as well.\nTechnical developments\nAnalysis\nof sequencing reads with chimeric adapters in a large-scale-multiplexing\nRNA-seq experiment\nIn the course of some of the research described above, we designed\nand tested sequencing adapters and library preparation methods that\nenabled us to characterise the types of polymerase mishaps that happen\nwhenever multiple different templates are being amplified together.\nMarisa and Rohan have been working on analysing various types of\nchimeric reads that are generated during our large-scale experiments\nwith a view to improve existing protocols to minimise the influence of\nsuch reads on genotyping.\nThe paper has now been published in Molecular Ecology Resources (open\naccess!): Identification\nand quantification of chimeric sequencing reads in a highly multiplexed\nRAD-seq protocol.\nAnalysis\nof non-target sequences in a large-scale RAD-seq experiment\nSimilarly, after amassing data from almost 1500 samples of\nApodemus mice, we realised that a non-trivial proportion of\nreads we collect come not from Apodemus but other organisms\n“contaminating” the samples. We were keen to see whether sequences of\nsome of the parasites and vectors that Apodemus carry, such as\nticks, Borrelia or hantaviruses could be retrieved from these\ncarryover sequences. After Marisa checked that, indeed,\nBorrelia and Ixodes could be sequenced in our\nApodemus RAD-seq protocol, Haeyam took over and during her\nplacement she established a Kraken-based pipeline to screen our samples\nfor microbial and insect sequences. We are currently polishing this\npipeline and are likely to be using it in our future experiments,\nRAD-seq or otherwise.\nWe expect that all the fundamental work described above will inform\nand direct our further high-resolution studies on adaptations, the main\ninterest of BrykLab.\n\nSeasonal\ncoat colour change in Mustela nivalis weasels\nThere are two subspecies of least weasels in north–eastern Poland.\nMustela nivalis nivalis and Mustela nivalis vulgaris.\nThey live in relative sympatry (M. n. vulgaris is a recent\ninvader from the south) and are similarly-looking during most of the\nyear. However, when the days start to get shorter, the coat of the\nM. n. nivalis changes to completely white, providing it with\ncamouflage and increased survival on snow cover, whereas the coat of the\nM. n. vulgaris stays a similar shade of brown during the entire\nyear.\n\nWe are collaborating with Dr Karol Zub at MRI PAS and Dr José\nMelo-Ferreira at the Research\nCentre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources at the University\nof Porto on elucidating the molecular and evolutionary forced\nunderlying the seasonal colour change.\nWe started from Sanger–sequencing a host of putative candidate genes\naffecting coat colour in order to exclude a possibility of stable\ncoding-sequence polymorphism affecting coat colour change, however, we\nwere unable to proceed much further due to lack of fresh samples of\nMustela. Fortunately, our colleagues in Portugal were\nmuch more successful with their high-throughput sequencing of\nmuseum samples.\nThe paper has now been published in MBE (open access!): Museomics\ndissects the genetic basis for adaptive seasonal colouration in the\nleast weasel.\n\nExperimental\nteaching resources in synthetic biology\nSynthetic biology has enjoyed an explosive growth and a dramatic rise\nin prominence in the last decade, but the branch of synthetic biology\nthat focuses on standardisation of DNA parts and thorough\ncharacterisation of genetic circuits still appears to be somewhat less\nthan what it should be (with the fantastic exception of the International Genetically Engineered\nMachines competition). There is still a lack of well–characterised\nand tested sets of parts that allow for introducing synthetic biology\nconcepts and techniques to secondary schools.\n\nNational Centre for\nBiotechnology Education at the University of Reading have been\nworking on a Wellcome Trust–funded project to develop experimental\nresources in synthetic biology for the A-level education, following our\nprevious work on the UNIGEMS project. This\nproject was completed by Alexandra Siddall and the set of 10 plasmids\nwith various DNA parts is available at http://www.addgene.org/Jaroslaw_Bryk/.\nThe preprint is now available on biorxiv: UNIGEMS:\nplasmids and parts to facilitate teaching on assembly, gene expression\ncontrol and logic in E. coli.\n\nFactors\naffecting student attainment at the University of Huddersfield\nSince 2019, I have been a member of a Strategic Teaching and Learning\nTeam by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Teaching and Learning) Office as a Data\nAnalyst. There, I mainly work on high-level analysis of students’\nattainment across the entire institution, using in-depth information on\nvarious characteristics of students, such as entry qualification,\nsocioeconomic status, ethnicity, and others. I also contribute to\nanalysis of student engagement with our VLE and help elucidate the\nimpact of the pandemic on students’ achievement, course assessment\nstructure and others. Along with Drs Vicki Trowler and John Stephenson,\nwe then try to provide social context for this data and statistical\nmodelling to highlight causative relationships in the data, to further\nsuppport the university in providing apropriate environment for\nstudents’ teaching and learning.\nRabbit’s Friends and\nRelations\nOur research would not be possible without these fantastic\ncollaborators:\nDr\nFrank Yinnguan Chan and Marek Kucka from the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of\nthe Max Planck Society in Tübingen, Germany (sequencing, library\npreparation)\nDr Karol\nZub and Dr Jan Boratyński from the Mammal Research Institute\nof the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland\n(Apodemus and Mustela samples, energetics,\necology)\nDr Jose\nMelo-Ferreira from the Research\nCentre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources at the University\nof Porto, Portugal (Mustela coat colouration)\nDr\nSteve Patterson from the University of Liverpool, UK\n(Apodemus 10x Genomics sequencing, genome annotation)\nDr Fiona Lane and Dr John Schollar from the National Centre for Biotechnology\nEducation at the University of\nReading, UK (synthetic biology, education)\nDr\nVicki Trowler and Dr John\nStephenson from the University of\nHuddersfield (student attainment project)\nMany others, who provided samples and/or expertise on\nApodemus phylogeography, sample preparation and/or data\nanalysis, especially: Dr Jochan Michaux, Dr Allan\nMcDevitt, Dr\nJeremy Herman, Dr Vladimir Jovanovic.\nFunders\nOur work has been supported by the University of Huddersfield, BBSRC STARS\nprogramme, Microsoft\nAzure for Research, Google Cloud\nPlatform and the NERC Biomolecular\nAnalysis Facility.\n\n\n\n",

The paper goes into detail on all the\n10 plasmids in the current collection and on how you can expand, swap or\nreplace the parts on your own.\nIntroduction\nThis website presents resources developed by me at the National Centre for Biotechnology\nEducation at the University of\nReading, under the UNIGEMS project funded by the European Commission\nin the 7th Framework Programme.\nThese resources are aimed at undergraduates and are thought to\nfacilitate training in synthetic biology at this level. We assume\nlimited knowledge of participants about the techniques and approaches\nin synthetic biology, but we expect the staff presenting the resources\nand running the practical activities will be familiar with basic\nmicrobiological and molecular biology techniques. They will equip the\nparticipants with foundational skills, techniques and approaches with\nwhich they can build and/or modify other genetic circuits, and assess\ntheir performance.\nThe resources are all based on intellectual-property-rights-free\nparts. All plasmids and parts can be used freely, and their sequences\n(and plasmids themselves) have been deposited in established\nrepositories (figshare.com and addgene.com) so that everyone could learn\nabout them and use them.\nThese protocols and pre-selected parts allow a practical introduction\nto basic techniques and approaches used in synthetic biology, and also\nintroduce good microbiological laboratory practice, a necessity for safe\nand responsible conduct in any synthetic biology project. They guide\nstudents in choosing their constructs and then modifying and measuring\nthem. We believe this creates engagement and ownership that sets these\npracticals apart from conventional “follow the recipe for the\npredetermined outcome” tasks during practical work.\nKit\n1: Bacterial transformation and basic microbiological techniques\n\nThe first practical “kit” is very much based on the simple\ntransformation protocol kit NCBE has been selling for the last year and\naims at introducing basic microbiological techniques and practical\nexperience of one of the foundational techniques in synthetic biology,\nnamely bacterial transformation. Students transform E. coli\nwith a plasmid DNA that confers resistance to antibiotic kanamycin, as\nwell as a gene encoding green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish\nAquorea victoria.\nKit 2: PCR, Gibson and DNA\nassembly\n\nThe second practical kit introduces another foundational technique in\nsynthetic biology - DNA assembly, as well as basic molecular biology\ntechniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Students use PCR to\ngenerate several DNA parts made on the template of plasmid DNA, and then\nassemble these parts in novel configurations to produce new plasmid\nmolecules, which are then used to transform bacteria. The\nnewly–assembled parts may also be sequenced to confirm correct assembly\nof the molecules. The plasmids the participants are able to create may\nencode:\ngreen fluorescent protein (that emits visible light upon UV/blue\nlight induction)\nred fluorescent protein that is also visible in daylight without the\nneed to excite it\na banana odour generator that makes bacteria smell like bananas upon\nadding isoamyl alcohol\na beta-galactosidase gene that encodes an enzyme that digests\nlactose.\nIt is worth emphasising that students themselves decide which of the\nplasmids they want to make and proceed to select appropriate PCR primers\nand calculate appropriate amounts of DNA parts for the assembly of their\nmolecules of choice. A group of students may create up to four different\nplasmids encoding different functions or proteins. These plasmids become\nthe basis of modifications and measurements in Kit 3.\nDNA assembly methods are currently a very dynamic research field, and\nnew or modified methods appear regularly. We have decided to use Gibson\nAssembly, as it is a relatively straightforward method that only\nrequires a single step, 60-minute-long reaction to combine several DNA\nparts in a desired order. While commercially-available reagents for\nGibson Assembly are expensive, in-house preparation of the master\nmixture reduces the costs considerably. Importantly, Gibson Assembly\nallows essentially any plasmid molecule to be turned into a vector or a\npart for the assembly, by virtue of design and selection of PCR primers,\na simple procedure that every molecular biology laboratory does\nregularly. We do note, however, that given an extremely rapid\ndevelopments in the field of DNA sequencing and synthesis, it is quite\nlikely that in several years all current assembly methods will become\nobsolete, as all and any DNA parts or whole plasmids will be ordered\nonline and synthesised commercially at low cost.\nKit 3: Engineering expression\n\nFinally, the third practical kit expands on the DNA assembly concept:\nit provides a set of new, ready-made parts that allow the expression of\ngenes on plasmids assembled using Kit 2 to be modified, using procedures\nlearnt in Kit 2: PCR and Gibson Assembly. The concept of this kit is\nmost similar to a definition of synthetic biology: ‘the construction of\nnovel genetic systems and pathways from a set of pre-optimised, pre-\ncharacterised and compatible DNA sequences to design organisms with\ndesirable characteristics’. The parts provided in the kit allow genes of\ninterest to be ‘switched on’ constitutively, or a􏰂er adding a certain\nchemical. It also permits the modulation of the activity of the genes.\nThe four genes on a plasmid in Kit 2 have been chosen so that each\nchallenges students to quantify their activity using a different\napproach. While both GFP and RFP activity could be measured by\nfluorimeter or cytometer, RFP is also visible in daylight, enabling\nvisual estimation of the RFP production by a given construct. The banana\nsmell must be measured with a series of standard “banana flavours” of\ndifferent strengths or by gas chromatography, and beta-galactosidase by\na colorimetric enzymatic reaction.\nSequences, plasmids, videos,\netc.\nPlasmid and promoter parts\nsequences\nThe plasmid sequences and maps used in the kits 1 and 2, p005kanRFP,\np006kanGFP and p007ampGFP, as well as sequences of the promoter parts\nused in kit 3, are\navailable\nfor download from Figshare.com. They can be opened using\nSnapGene software (paid, but with\n1 month free trial available) or with the\nfree\nSnapGene viewer. Moreover, the plasmid molecules were deposited in\nan open repository\nAddgene.org.\nPractical\nsynthetic biology workshop for undergraduates\n\nThe resources presented on this page were trialed during their\ndevelopment on a workshop for undergraduates at the University of\nReading in June 2013.\nThe report\nfrom this course is available for download, as it may serve as\nuseful guide to what approach to use to introduce basic synthetic\nbiology techniques and approaches to students.\nContact me\nAll questions, suggestions, comments and corrections regarding these\nmaterials should be directed to me via\nemail or\nTwitter.\nFunding\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh\nFramework Programme for research, technological development and\ndemonstration under grant agreement No. 300038.\n\n\n\n",
