Following my interest in science education and communication, after the university I co–founded and directed Science Festival School at the International Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw. It was one of the first full–time bioscience popularisation organisations in Poland and it is still active today as the Centre for Innovative Bioscience Education.\nHaving decided to learn more and do research in evolutionary genetics, I started my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where I worked on metabolic and behavioural consequences of expression of putatively adaptive human genes in transgenic mice. I generated mice transgenic for genes thought to be important in human evolution, like GLUD2, a hominoid-specific gene encoding neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase or a group of genes including ASPM and CENPJ that play a role in brain development and whose mutations cause microcephaly in humans. During my PhD I become more interested in functional and mechanistic basis of adaptive change, and followed this direction during a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany, where I worked on identification of putatively adaptive genes in wild, non-model organism using whole–genome approaches. I studied copy-number variants in natural populations of Mus musculus domestics using custom made microarrays and microsatellite scans to identify CNVs under putative selective sweeps.\nI then switched my focus back to teaching and became involved in secondary and undergraduate education in the National Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading, UK, where I undertook a EU–funded project to develop practical teaching resources in synthetic biology for undergraduates. I worked on development of DNA parts, plasmids and protocols to manipulate them, as well as organised workshops for undergraduates and A-level students in synthetic biology. I helped establish and mentored the first Reading team for the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition, where the student–driven project—construction and characterisation of solar–powered, cyanobacteria-based fuel cell was awarded a bronze medal. During a subsequent Wellcome Trust’s Society Award to NCBE, I initiated development of similar experimental synthetic biology resources for A–level students before joining University of Huddersfield.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nI very much like the idea of having expectations and responsibilities to graduate and undergraduate students in the lab explicitly stated. Even though it seems quite obvious, I first heard it from Terry McGlynn at Small Pond Science and from Melissa Wilson–Sayres on Twitter (you should follow them both, by the way, they are awesome). And now, with some time as a PI under my belt and having some experience with both graduate and final-year undergraduate students, I can set up my own list (the one below is mostly based on Melissa’s, but was also influenced by J. Cameron Thrash’s list).\nMy responsibilities to graduate students:\nHelp develop project ideas.\nMeet at least bi-weekly to discuss project’s progress, pitfalls and plans.\nSupport travel to at least one meeting or workshop per year.\nAssist with data interpretation.\nProof-read and contribute to writing of manuscripts, fellowships and grants.\nProvide training and mentorship in soft skills, including teaching.\nDiscuss future career goals and career development, including careers outside academia.\nAssure appropriate working conditions and resources throughout the project.\nMy expectations of graduate students:\nPrepare for and participate in regular lab meetings.\nMaintain a set of lab notes, from both wet–lab and in silico work.

They occupy environments as different as Spain and Siberia, contribute to spread of human diseases like Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis and are a rich target for evolutionary studies. However, they are very underdeveloped in terms of their genomic and genetic resources. Our long-term goal is to help establish Apodemus as a full–blown model organism and utilise its generalist ecology for studies of evolution in the wild.\n\nPhylogeography of Apodemus mice\nThe major project we are currently undertaking is on improving the European phylogeography of the two species, Apodemus flavicolis (yellow-necked mouse, also confusingly called wood mouse in Polish) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse). The goal is to collect and describe large(ish)-scale (n > 350 samples) data on genetic diversity and connectivity of the species and help answer some of the mysteries of recolonisation of Europe by small mammals following the last glaciation. The project is helmed by Maria Luisa Martin Cerezo and utilises restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to obtain whole-genome, high-density genotypes even without a reference genome. It has been possible thanks to a number of colleagues across Europe, from Scotland and Portugal through Serbia to Lithuania, who provided samples from across the range of both species.\nThe first publication from this project, a small-scale phylogeographic analysis of Polish populations of Apodemus, has been published in 2020: Population structure of Apodemus flavicollis and comparison to Apodemus sylvaticus in northern Poland based on RAD-seq\nGenetics and energetics in Apodemus mice\nThe second project, run by Rohan Raval in collaboration with Drs Karol Zub and Jan Boratyński at the Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland, will characterise the patterns of metabolic rates in a single population of A flavicolis continually sampled for multiple seasons. The project involves genotyping and pedigree analysis of a large, wild population of mice and lab-based measures of basal metabolic rates (BMR) and torpor. Our goal is to measure heritability of BMR in the wild throughout multiple seasons as well as in-depth characterisation of population structure and dynamics.\nSeventy years of genetic variation in a population of Apodemus flavicolis in Białowieża forest\nDue its wide range and large population size, Apodemus has been a popular ecological model organism since a long time before the advent of modern sequencing methods. Many museums and field stations have amassed collections of Apodemus samples, which are a large and largely untapped resource of genetic history of these species. The challenge in accessing this information is degradation of DNA, making it difficult to obtain a set of orthologous loci from multiple individuals. We have recently been funded by NERC NBAF to develop and/or modify existing DNA pull-down methods to extract orthologous loci from even highly degraded DNA and use it in RAD-seq genotyping. On this project, we are collaborating with MRI PAS, thanks to whom we have access to an extensive collection of Apodemus samples dating back to the second World War and with prof. Nadir Alvarez from the Natural History Museum of Geneva in Switzerland, who previously developed RAD-seq pull-down techniques to be used in insects and plants. We hope that these methods will enable spatial and temporal comparisons of genetic diversity in Apodemus as well.\nTechnical developments\nAnalysis of sequencing reads with chimeric adapters in a large-scale-multiplexing RNA-seq experiment\nIn the course of some of the research described above, we designed and tested sequencing adapters and library preparation methods that enabled us to characterise the types of polymerase mishaps that happen whenever multiple different templates are being amplified together. Marisa and Rohan have been working on analysing various types of chimeric reads that are generated during our large-scale experiments with a view to improve existing protocols to minimise the influence of such reads on genotyping.\nAnalysis of non-target sequences in a large-scale RAD-seq experiment\nSimilarly, after amassing data from almost 1500 samples of Apodemus mice, we realised that a non-trivial proportion of reads we collect come not from Apodemus but other organisms “contaminating” the samples. We were keen to see whether sequences of some of the parasites and vectors that Apodemus carry, such as ticks, Borrelia or hantaviruses could be retrieved from these carryover sequences. After Marisa checked that, indeed, Borrelia and Ixodes could be sequenced in our Apodemus RAD-seq protocol, Haeyam took over and during her placement she established a Kraken-based pipeline to screen our samples for microbial and insect sequences. We are currently polishing this pipeline and are likely to be using it in our future experiments, RAD-seq or otherwise.\nWe expect that all the fundamental work described above will inform and direct our further high-resolution studies on adaptations, the main interest of BrykLab.\n\nSeasonal coat colour change in Mustela nivalis weasels\nThere are two subspecies of least weasels in north–eastern Poland. Mustela nivalis nivalis and Mustela nivalis vulgaris. They live in relative sympatry (M. n. vulgaris is a recent invader from the south) and are similarly-looking during most of the year. However, when the days start to get shorter, the coat of the M. n. nivalis changes to completely white, providing it with camouflage and increased survival on snow cover, whereas the coat of the M. n. vulgaris stays a similar shade of brown during the entire year.\n\nWe are collaborating with Dr Karol Zub at MRI PAS and Dr José Melo-Ferreira at the Research Centre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources at the University of Porto on elucidating the molecular and evolutionary forced underlying the seasonal colour change.\nWe started from Sanger–sequencing a host of putative candidate genes affecting coat colour in order to exclude a possibility of stable coding-sequence polymorphism affecting coat colour change, however, we were unable to proceed much further due to lack of fresh samples of Mustela. Fortunately, our colleagues in Portugal were much more successful with their high-throughput sequencing of museum samples. Watch this space :-)\n\nExperimental teaching resources in synthetic biology\nSynthetic biology has enjoyed an explosive growth and a dramatic rise in prominence in the last decade, but the branch of synthetic biology that focuses on standardisation of DNA parts and thorough characterisation of genetic circuits still appears to be somewhat less than what it should be (with the fantastic exception of the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition). There is still a lack of well–characterised and tested sets of parts that allow for introducing synthetic biology concepts and techniques to secondary schools.\n\nNational Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading have been working on a Wellcome Trust–funded project to develop experimental resources in synthetic biology for the A-level education, following our previous work on the UNIGEMS project. This project was completed by Alexandra Siddall and the set of 10 plasmids with various DNA parts is available at http://www.addgene.org/Jaroslaw_Bryk/. The publication describing them is in preparation.\n\nFactors affecting student attainment at the University of Huddersfield\nSince 2019, I have been a member of a Strategic Teaching and Learning Team by the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Teaching and Learning) Office as a Data Analyst. There, I mainly work on high-level analysis of students’ attainment across the entire institution, using in-depth information on various characteristics of students, such as entry qualification, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and others. I also contribute to analysis of student engagement with our VLE and help elucidate the impact of the pandemic on students’ achievement, course assessment structure and others. Along with Drs Vicki Trowler and John Stephenson, we then try to provide social context for this data and statistical modelling to highlight causative relationships in the data, to further suppport the university in providing apropriate environment for students’ teaching and learning.\nRabbit’s Friends and Relations\nOur research would not be possible without these fantastic collaborators:\nDr Frank Yinnguan Chan and Marek Kucka from the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society in Tübingen, Germany (sequencing, library preparation)\nDr Karol Zub and Dr Jan Boratyński from the Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS) in Białowieża, Poland (Apodemus and Mustela samples, energetics, ecology)\nDr Jose Melo-Ferreira from the Research Centre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources at the University of Porto, Portugal (Mustela coat colouration)\nDr Steve Patterson from the University of Liverpool, UK (Apodemus 10x Genomics sequencing, genome annotation)\nDr Fiona Lane and Dr John Schollar from the National Centre for Biotechnology Education at the University of Reading, UK (synthetic biology, education)\nDr Vicki Trowler and Dr John Stephenson from the University of Huddersfield (student attainment project)\nMany others, who provided samples and/or expertise on Apodemus phylogeography, sample preparation and/or data analysis, especially: Dr Jochan Michaux, Dr Allan McDevitt, Dr Jeremy Herman, Dr Vladimir Jovanovic.\nFunders\nOur work has been supported by the University of Huddersfield, BBSRC STARS programme, Microsoft Azure for Research, Google Cloud Platform and the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility.\n\n\n\n",

This is a network of bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England. Inspired by the Scottish NextGenBUG we hold quarterly meetings to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. This is a Sectional Interest Group officially supported by The Genetics Society. Currently on hiatus due to pandemic\nSynthetic biology\nWe have been developing a series of DNA parts and protocols to facilitate teaching about synthetic biology in higher education. The website at practicalsyntheticbiology.net presents the current set of parts and other resources, but they have been overhauled - thanks to the work of Alex Siddall in my group and Jason Sanders from the School of Arts and Design here at Huddersfield, we are expanding the number of parts available and preparing a new set of printed and digital materials to go with them. Stay tuned!\nCoding Club\nCoding club is an informal series of meetings for postgraduate students and interested staff with the aim of introducing command-line coding and R programming. We meet every week for two hours in a small group to learn and practice shell scripting and R data analysis. Currently on hiatus\nLists of links at Github\nBelow is the set of websites where I maintain a list of resources about which students ask again and again. Each of the websites is maintained at Github and everybody is welcome to contribute to expanding and improving them.\nComputational biology FTW\nMy ever-growing list of resources to get into computational biology. I am a big fan of R and use it both in my teaching and research and am always on the lookout for good approaches to teach and learn it. Shell is another must-have in computational biology (see above) and so I am trying to stay on top of it all by following a bunch of excellent people on Twitter and collecting good resources on this list.\nHow to run a local BLAST\nThis is a short tutorial on how to install and run BLAST on your local computer. I provide example input file and a database and a copy of BLAST options from the NCBI website (which I find is not very easy to follow). It’s now over a year old but is still accurate (although do pay attention to a sneaky option -max_target_seqs).\nStats for students\nList of online resources about statistics, aimed at undergraduates but useful to anyone :-)\nCareer advice, placements and funding opportunities\nThis is my collection of links about sources of funding and career advice, mostly relevant to undergraduates and graduate students. I needed them in a single place so that I am able to direct students there who ask me about this quite often. I also tried to make it a bit more UK-centred compared to what is available on the web already.\nPast activities\nNext Generation Biologists workshops\nThis is a BBSRC STARS-programme-funded project that I am involved in alongside Dr Mary J. O’Connell, formerly at the University of Leeds and currently at the University of Notingham) and Martin Callaghan from the University of Leeds. We run a series of workshops to introduce and train researchers in the skills and best practices in scientific computing and bioinformatics. You can read all about the project and the workshops on the website nextgenbiologists.org. This project ended in February 2020\nProgramming for Evolutionary Biology 2018 conference\nThe Programming for Evolutionary Biology (PEB) conference brings together scientists broadly interested in applying bioinformatic tools to answer evolutionary and ecological questions. Unlike other conferences featuring mostly talks and poster sessions, it aims to serve as a platform for discussing common programming pitfalls encountered during research and features workshops to further develop participants’ bioinformatic skills. This project happened and was really nice :-)\n\n\n\n",

We assume limited knowledge of participants about the techniques and approaches in synthetic biology, but we expect the staff presenting the resources and running the practical activities will be familiar with basic microbiological and molecular biology techniques. They will equip the participants with foundational skills, techniques and approaches with which they can build and/or modify other genetic circuits, and assess their performance.\nThe resources are all based on intellectual-property-rights-free parts. All plasmids and parts can be used freely, and their sequences (and plasmids themselves) have been deposited in established repositories (figshare.com and addgene.com) so that everyone could learn about them and use them.\nThese protocols and pre-selected parts allow a practical introduction to basic techniques and approaches used in synthetic biology, and also introduce good microbiological laboratory practice, a necessity for safe and responsible conduct in any synthetic biology project. They guide students in choosing their constructs and then modifying and measuring them. We believe this creates engagement and ownership that sets these practicals apart from conventional “follow the recipe for the predetermined outcome” tasks during practical work.\nKit 1: Bacterial transformation and basic microbiological techniques\n\nThe first practical “kit” is very much based on the simple transformation protocol kit NCBE has been selling for the last year and aims at introducing basic microbiological techniques and practical experience of one of the foundational techniques in synthetic biology, namely bacterial transformation. Students transform E. coli with a plasmid DNA that confers resistance to antibiotic kanamycin, as well as a gene encoding green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish Aquorea victoria.\nKit 2: PCR, Gibson and DNA assembly\n\nThe second practical kit introduces another foundational technique in synthetic biology - DNA assembly, as well as basic molecular biology techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Students use PCR to generate several DNA parts made on the template of plasmid DNA, and then assemble these parts in novel configurations to produce new plasmid molecules, which are then used to transform bacteria. The newly–assembled parts may also be sequenced to confirm correct assembly of the molecules. The plasmids the participants are able to create may encode:\ngreen fluorescent protein (that emits visible light upon UV/blue light induction)\nred fluorescent protein that is also visible in daylight without the need to excite it\na banana odour generator that makes bacteria smell like bananas upon adding isoamyl alcohol\na beta-galactosidase gene that encodes an enzyme that digests lactose.\nIt is worth emphasising that students themselves decide which of the plasmids they want to make and proceed to select appropriate PCR primers and calculate appropriate amounts of DNA parts for the assembly of their molecules of choice. A group of students may create up to four different plasmids encoding different functions or proteins. These plasmids become the basis of modifications and measurements in Kit 3.\nDNA assembly methods are currently a very dynamic research field, and new or modified methods appear regularly. We have decided to use Gibson Assembly, as it is a relatively straightforward method that only requires a single step, 60-minute-long reaction to combine several DNA parts in a desired order. While commercially-available reagents for Gibson Assembly are expensive, in-house preparation of the master mixture reduces the costs considerably. Importantly, Gibson Assembly allows essentially any plasmid molecule to be turned into a vector or a part for the assembly, by virtue of design and selection of PCR primers, a simple procedure that every molecular biology laboratory does regularly. We do note, however, that given an extremely rapid developments in the field of DNA sequencing and synthesis, it is quite likely that in several years all current assembly methods will become obsolete, as all and any DNA parts or whole plasmids will be ordered online and synthesised commercially at low cost.\nKit 3: Engineering expression\n\nFinally, the third practical kit expands on the DNA assembly concept: it provides a set of new, ready-made parts that allow the expression of genes on plasmids assembled using Kit 2 to be modified, using procedures learnt in Kit 2: PCR and Gibson Assembly. The concept of this kit is most similar to a definition of synthetic biology: ‘the construction of novel genetic systems and pathways from a set of pre-optimised, pre- characterised and compatible DNA sequences to design organisms with desirable characteristics’. The parts provided in the kit allow genes of interest to be ‘switched on’ constitutively, or a􏰂er adding a certain chemical. It also permits the modulation of the activity of the genes. The four genes on a plasmid in Kit 2 have been chosen so that each challenges students to quantify their activity using a different approach. While both GFP and RFP activity could be measured by fluorimeter or cytometer, RFP is also visible in daylight, enabling visual estimation of the RFP production by a given construct. The banana smell must be measured with a series of standard “banana flavours” of different strengths or by gas chromatography, and beta-galactosidase by a colorimetric enzymatic reaction.\nSequences, plasmids, videos, etc.\nGibson assembly video\nThe video below presents simple Gibson Assembly reaction used to swap antibiotic resistance genes between two plasmids, as performed in silico with SnapGene software. We use this video in the second kit, to familiarise participants of the course with the software, and try an analogous procedure to what they attempt during the course.\n\n\nPlasmid and promoter parts sequences\nThe plasmid sequences and maps used in the kits 1 and 2, p005kanRFP, p006kanGFP and p007ampGFP, as well as sequences of the promoter parts used in kit 3, are available for download from Figshare.com. They can be opened using SnapGene software (paid, but with 1 month free trial available) or with the free SnapGene viewer. Moreover, the plasmid molecules were deposited in an open repository Addgene.org.\nPractical synthetic biology workshop for undergraduates\n\nThe resources presented on this page were trialed during their development on a workshop for undergraduates at the University of Reading in June 2013. The report from this course is available for download, as it may serve as useful guide to what approach to use to introduce basic synthetic biology techniques and approaches to students.\nContact me\nAll questions, suggestions, comments and corrections regarding these materials should be directed to me via email or Twitter.\nFunding\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No. 300038.\n\n\n\n",
