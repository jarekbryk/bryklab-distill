I studied biology and obtained MSc in molecular biology from the [University of Warsaw](http://www.biol.uw.edu.pl), Poland. Following my interest in science education and communication, after the university I co–founded and directed [Science Festival School](http://www.iimcb.gov.pl/cibe.html) at the [International Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology](http://www.iimcb.gov.pl) in Warsaw. It was one of the first full–time bioscience popularisation organisations in Poland and it is still active today as the [Centre for Innovative Bioscience Education](http://www.biocen.edu.pl/en/).

Having decided to learn more and do research in evolutionary genetics, I started my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](http://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html) in Leipzig, Germany, where I worked on metabolic and behavioural consequences of expression of putatively adaptive human genes in transgenic mice. I generated mice transgenic for genes thought to be important in human evolution, like GLUD2, a hominoid-specific gene encoding neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase or a group of genes including ASPM and CENPJ that play a role in brain development and whose mutations cause microcephaly in humans. During my PhD I become more interested in functional and mechanistic basis of adaptive change, and followed this direction during a postdoc at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en) in Plön, Germany, where I worked on identification of putatively adaptive genes in wild, non-model organism using whole–genome approaches. I studied copy-number variants in natural populations of <i>Mus musculus domestics</i> using custom made microarrays and microsatellite scans to identify CNVs under putative selective sweeps.

I then switched my focus back to teaching and became involved in secondary and undergraduate education in the [National Centre for Biotechnology Education](http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk) at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk), UK, where I undertook a EU–funded project to develop practical teaching resources in synthetic biology for undergraduates. I worked on development of [DNA parts, plasmids and protocols to manipulate them](http://practicalsyntheticbiology.net/resources), as well as organised workshops for undergraduates and A-level students in synthetic biology. I helped establish and mentored the first Reading team for the [International Genetically Engineered Machines competition](http://igem.org/Main_Page), where the student–driven project—[construction and characterisation of solar–powered, cyanobacteria-based fuel cell](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Reading) was awarded a bronze medal. During a subsequent Wellcome Trust’s Society Award to NCBE, I initiated development of similar experimental synthetic biology resources for A–level students before joining University of Huddersfield.
